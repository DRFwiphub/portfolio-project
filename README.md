# Project Overview

The Idea behind this project is to be seen as a portfolio page for the progression of my career, this also means that as my confidence and skill grows, the page will evolve to reflect that.

The initial Intent is for the user to access the page, find out about me, be able to see some of my work and ultimately be able to contact me in various ways.
